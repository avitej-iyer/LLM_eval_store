ADCY4 encodes adenylate cyclase 4, an enzyme involved in the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger that regulates various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis. TSHZ1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. 


The interplay of these proteins suggests a coordinated effort in supporting ribosome biogenesis. YARS2 directly contributes to protein synthesis, ADCY4 influences the regulatory pathways controlling ribosome biogenesis, and TSHZ1 directly regulates the expression of genes essential for this process.

GP1BA, GP9, GP5, and GP1BB are components of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex, a receptor on the platelet surface that binds von Willebrand factor (vWF) and mediates platelet adhesion to the subendothelium during initial stages of hemostasis. F12 (Hageman factor) is a key initiator of the coagulation cascade, while F8 (Factor VIII) is a crucial cofactor for Factor IXa in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. FLNA (Filamin A) is a cytoskeletal protein involved in platelet shape change and aggregation. APOH (Apolipoprotein H) is a protein with anti-coagulant properties.
