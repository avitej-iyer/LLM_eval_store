The system consists of multiple cilia-related proteins, including DNAH9, CFAP221, CFAP45, CFAP54, and DNAAF11, which are known to be involved in the assembly and maintenance of cilia. DNAH9, for example, is a dynein heavy chain that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of cilia, while CFAP221 and CFAP45 are involved in the assembly of the dynein complex. DNAAF11, on the other hand, is a protein that interacts with the dynein complex and is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia.

2. Other proteins in the system, such as AQP4 and CFAP43, are also involved in cilia-related processes. AQP4, for example, is a water channel protein that is localized to the cilium and plays a role in the regulation of ciliary fluid flow. CFAP43, meanwhile, is a protein that interacts with the dynein complex and is involved in the assembly and maintenance of cilia.

3. In addition to their roles in cilia assembly and maintenance, some proteins in the system have been implicated in other cellular processes, such as cell signaling and regulation. NHERF1, for example, is a protein that interacts with various receptors and channels and plays a role in regulating cell signaling pathways.

4. The system also includes several proteins that are involved in the regulation of cilia function, including ODAD3 and ODAD4. These proteins interact with the dynein complex and are essential for the regulation of ciliary beat frequency and direction.

5. The architecture of the system suggests that the proteins are integrated into a functional network that is involved in the assembly and maintenance of cilia. The presence of multiple cilia-related proteins and the interactions between them suggest that the system is involved in a specific biological process, namely cilia assembly and maintenance.

While the system is primarily involved in cilia assembly and maintenance, the presence of proteins involved in other cellular processes, such as cell signaling and regulation, suggests that the system may also play a role in these processes to some extent. However, the dominant function of the system appears to be cilia-related, and therefore, cilia assembly and maintenance is the most prominent biological process performed by the system."	0.85

2. The interplay among these proteins ensures the proper progression of mitosis and DNA repair. 
   For instance, the condensin complex (NCAPG, NCAPH, NCAPG2, NCAPH2, and SMC2) works in conjunction with the spindle checkpoint (MAD2L1BP, BIRC5, and RAD18) to ensure accurate chromosome segregation.
   Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (KAT2B, KAT5, and SIRT2) modify chromatin structure to facilitate or inhibit the progression of mitosis and DNA repair.
   The cell cycle regulators (CDCA8, CDK1, and INCENP) ensure proper progression through the cell cycle, while the DNA damage response proteins (RAD18 and BIRC5) repair DNA damage.

3. The functional integration of these proteins is crucial for maintaining genome stability and preventing aneuploidy.
   The synergy among these proteins ensures that errors in chromosome segregation are detected and corrected, preventing the propagation of genetic abnormalities.
   However, the antagonistic effects of these proteins also prevent the excessive activation of the spindle checkpoint, which can lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

4. While the system is primarily involved in mitotic checkpoint regulation and DNA repair, some proteins (NUMA1, RCC2, and BECN1) also play roles in other cellular processes, such as centrosome regulation and autophagy.

For example, GPX1 and GPX4 catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), while GCLC and GCLM regulate the synthesis of glutathione.

3. Other antioxidant proteins (e.g., SOD2, SOD1, PARK7) help to neutralize ROS and maintain cellular redox homeostasis. SOD2 and SOD1 are superoxide dismutases that convert superoxide into hydrogen peroxide, which is then reduced by GPX1 and GPX4. PARK7 is a redox-sensitive protein that helps to maintain the integrity of mitochondria.

4. The glutathione S-conjugate export protein, SLC7A11, facilitates the export of glutathione S-conjugates from cells, helping to maintain the redox balance.

While the system of interacting proteins appears to be involved in cellular antioxidant defense and detoxification, the confidence score of 0.88 reflects the fact that not all proteins in the system are directly involved in this process.

2. SCAP and SREBF1/SREBF2 form a complex that regulates the activation of SREBPs, which in turn control the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. SCAP is a component of the SREBP activation complex, while SREBF1 and SREBF2 are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis.

3. The ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, in conjunction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, regulates the degradation of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and other proteins involved in lipid homeostasis. This suggests a regulatory mechanism that controls the levels of SREBPs and thereby lipid synthesis.

4. EIF2A is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, which is also linked to lipid metabolism. The regulation of protein synthesis can impact lipid synthesis by controlling the availability of lipids for energy production and storage.

5. The ER-resident proteins ERLIN1 and ERLIN2 are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, particularly in the context of lipid droplet formation and lipid storage.

3. GHITM (Glycosyl hydrolase, immunoglobulin-like domain containing, transmembrane) is a protein with a glycosyl hydrolase domain, which suggests a potential role in carbohydrate metabolism or cell-cell interactions. However, its relationship to the other proteins in the system is unclear, and it may not be directly involved in cell cycle progression.

In summary, the genes in this set are primarily involved in regulating cell cycle progression, particularly during the G2/M transition. While CHCHD2 and GHITM may have indirect or secondary roles, the architecture of the system suggests a focus on cell cycle regulation. However, the involvement of these genes in cell cycle progression is not as clear-cut as in the example system, which is why the confidence score is lower."	0.8

FRAT1 and FRAT2 are regulatory proteins that inhibit the GSK3B-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-catenin. 
They form a complex with GSK3B and prevent its access to β-catenin, thus stabilizing the protein and promoting its accumulation in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
This accumulation leads to the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which regulates various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

2. PPP1CA is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3B.
The dephosphorylation of GSK3B by PP1 leads to its inactivation, which in turn prevents the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin.
This interaction between PP1 and GSK3B is crucial for the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

The interplay between FRAT1, FRAT2, PPP1CA, and GSK3B suggests that this system of interacting proteins is involved in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
This pathway plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer progression.
The regulation of this pathway is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and preventing disease.

The score of 0.85 indicates a moderate level of confidence in the proposed process name, as the involvement of all four proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is well-established, but the specific interactions and regulatory mechanisms may vary depending on the cellular context."	0.85

The given set of interacting proteins appears to be involved in the development and regulation of multiple tissues, including the pancreas and kidneys. Several transcription factors, such as SIX4, IRX1, IRX3, and SOX8, are involved in the specification and differentiation of pancreatic and kidney cells. For example, SIX4 and IRX3 have been implicated in the development of the pancreas and kidneys, while SOX8 has been shown to play a role in the development of the pancreas.

Additionally, several signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and BMP pathways, are present in this system. WNT11, WNT1, WNT4, and WNT6 are all part of the Wnt family, which plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation. BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 (not present in the list, but often associated with BMP2) are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

Other proteins in the system, such as GDNF, WNK4, and PKD2, are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in the kidneys. GDNF is a neurotrophic factor that promotes the survival and differentiation of kidney cells, while WNK4 and PKD2 are involved in the regulation of ion transport and cell growth in the kidneys.

However, a closer examination of the system reveals that a majority of the genes are not specifically involved in pancreatic or kidney development. Many of the genes in the system are involved in other biological processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, and tissue development in general.

Therefore, while the system appears to be involved in the development and regulation of multiple tissues, including the pancreas and kidneys, the most prominent biological process performed by the system is not as specific as the example analysis output suggests. The score of 0.55 reflects the involvement of a subset of genes in pancreatic and kidney development, but also acknowledges the presence of genes involved in other biological processes.

The lack of specificity in the process name is due to the presence of genes involved in other biological processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, and tissue development in general. A more specific process name could not be assigned due to the complexity and diversity of the biological processes represented in the system."	0.55

They play a crucial role in the detoxification of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including aldehydes and ketones.
AKR1A1 has been shown to reduce a wide range of substrates, including aldehydes and ketones, while AKR1B1 has been implicated in the reduction of 9-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid and other fatty acid-derived aldehydes.

2. RGN (Regan isomerase) is a member of the aldo-keto reductase family and is involved in the reduction of various aldehydes, including 9-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid.
It has been shown to have a role in the detoxification of fatty acid-derived aldehydes and in the metabolism of various xenobiotics.

The interplay between these enzymes is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress.
They work synergistically to reduce a wide range of substrates, including aldehydes and ketones, thereby preventing cellular damage.

However, the proportion of genes in this system that participate in carbohydrate metabolism is relatively low, with AKR1A1 and AKR1B1 showing a more significant involvement in detoxification processes.
Therefore, the confidence score for this process is 0.60.

The system appears to be more closely related to detoxification and aldehyde reduction, rather than carbohydrate metabolism.
A more specific name for the system might be ""Aldo-keto reductase family involved in detoxification and aldehyde reduction"", but this is not as concise as the current name.

It is worth noting that the system of interacting proteins appears to be more closely related to detoxification processes than carbohydrate metabolism, and a more specific name might be more accurate."	0.6

The proteins can be broadly categorized into two groups: those involved in the degradation of mRNA (DCPS, CNOT7, PATL2, ZFP36, PNRC2, LSM1, NOCT, DCP2, DCP1A, DCP1B, PATL1, EDC3, EDC4) and those involved in the regulation of translation (CAPRIN1, NUDT12, EIF4ENIF1).

The mRNA degradation pathway is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and involves the recognition and degradation of specific mRNAs. The proteins in this pathway, such as CNOT7 and PATL2, are involved in the decapping and deadenylation of mRNAs, while others, such as ZFP36 and PNRC2, are involved in the recognition and binding of specific mRNAs.

The translation regulation pathway involves the regulation of mRNA translation and involves proteins such as CAPRIN1 and EIF4ENIF1. These proteins are involved in the recruitment of ribosomes to specific mRNAs and the regulation of translation initiation.

The interplay between these proteins is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and involves both synergistic and antagonistic effects. For example, the degradation of specific mRNAs by the mRNA degradation pathway can regulate the availability of translationally active mRNAs for the translation regulation pathway.

The functional integration of these proteins is essential for the proper regulation of gene expression and involves the coordination of multiple pathways to ensure proper mRNA degradation and translation regulation. The architecture of this system ensures proper regulation of gene expression in response to various cellular signals.

While the proteins in this system are involved in critical cellular processes, the lack of a clear, prominent biological process that involves the majority of the genes in the system is a limitation of this analysis. However, based on the available information, the most prominent biological process performed by the system is mRNA degradation and translation regulation."	0.85

   NSD2, MSH2, PMS2, and MLH1 are key components of the DNA mismatch repair machinery, which corrects errors in DNA replication and recombination.
   NSD2 is a histone methyltransferase that plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation, while also being involved in DNA repair.
   MSH2 and MLH1 form a heterodimer that recognizes and corrects mismatched bases, while PMS2 interacts with MLH1 to form a functional complex.

   TNFSF13 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and plays a role in the regulation of immune cells, including B cells and T cells.
   TGFB1 is a cytokine that regulates cell growth, differentiation, and immune responses, including the activation of immune cells and the regulation of inflammation.

3. CCR6 is a chemokine receptor that plays a role in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflammation. It is expressed on various immune cells, including T cells and dendritic cells.

4. The interaction between these proteins suggests a functional integration between DNA mismatch repair and immune response pathways.
   For example, the activation of immune cells by TNFSF13 and TGFB1 may be influenced by the DNA repair status of these cells, as errors in DNA replication can lead to the activation of immune responses.

The proportion of genes involved in these processes is approximately 50%, with NSD2 and THOC1 having roles in both DNA repair and immune response, and the other proteins having distinct functions in these pathways.
However, the involvement of these proteins in distinct processes and the lack of clear synergistic effects between DNA mismatch repair and immune response pathways limits the confidence score to 0.72."	0.72

The system consists of a diverse set of proteins, including ion channels (CACNG8, GRIN2B, GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2D, GRIN2C), receptors (ADORA2A, DRD3, DRD1, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR1B), and modulators (DGKI, FXR1, GRIK3, GRIK2, GRIK1) that are involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. These proteins are primarily located in the postsynaptic density and play critical roles in regulating the strength and efficacy of synaptic transmission.

2. The presence of ion channels and receptors suggests that the system is involved in the regulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. For example, GRIN2B is a subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and learning. Similarly, ADORA2A is an adenosine receptor that modulates the strength of synaptic transmission.

3. The system also includes proteins involved in the regulation of neuronal morphology and cytoskeleton dynamics, such as IQSEC2, SYT1, and UNC13A. These proteins are involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle release and neurotransmitter release.

4. The presence of proteins involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity suggests that the system is involved in the regulation of cognitive functions, such as learning and memory.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the system is not as cohesive as initially thought. The presence of a diverse set of proteins with different functions and locations suggests that the system may not be as tightly regulated as previously thought. Additionally, the lack of a clear central hub or coordinator suggests that the system may not be as integrated as previously thought.

Therefore, while the system appears to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability, the lack of a clear central hub or coordinator and the diversity of proteins involved suggests that the system may not be as cohesive as initially thought."	0.85

Several key components of this system, including DEPTOR, SESN3, RHEB, TSC2, TSC1, and RPS6KB1, are known to play critical roles in the regulation of mTORC1 activity.

DEPTOR is a negative regulator of mTORC1, while SESN3 and SESN1 are involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process that is closely linked to mTORC1 signaling. RHEB is a GTPase that activates mTORC1, while TSC2 and TSC1 form a complex that inhibits mTORC1 activity in response to nutrient and energy availability.

The presence of AKT1, a kinase that phosphorylates and activates mTORC1, further supports the involvement of this system in mTORC1 signaling. Additionally, the presence of EP300, a transcriptional coactivator that can interact with mTORC1, suggests a role in the regulation of gene expression in response to mTORC1 activity.

The involvement of autophagy-related proteins such as SESN3, SESN1, and LAMTOR3 also supports the idea that this system is involved in the regulation of autophagy. Autophagy is a critical process that allows cells to recycle damaged or dysfunctional organelles and proteins, and its dysregulation has been implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

This leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase, resulting in the increase of intracellular cAMP levels and the subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates and activates various downstream targets, including the L-type calcium channels in cardiac muscle, leading to increased cardiac contractility.

2.

3. The ADRA1A and ADRA1B proteins are alpha-adrenergic receptors that, upon activation, stimulate the Gi protein-coupled signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels. This results in the relaxation of smooth muscle and a decrease in cardiac contractility.

4. The DRD5 protein is a dopamine receptor that, upon activation, stimulates the Gi protein-coupled signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels. This results in the relaxation of smooth muscle and a decrease in cardiac contractility.

The system consists of various components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including enzymes (CYP11B2, ACE, ACE2, CTSZ), receptors (AGTR1, AGTR2, AVPR1A, AVPR2, EDNRB, EDN1, EDN2, EDN3), and other interacting proteins (HSD11B2, REN, RHOA, NOS3, ENPEP, AGT, PCSK5, CPA3, OXTR). These components are involved in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and fluid homeostasis.

2. CYP11B2, the gene encoding aldosterone synthase, is crucial for the production of aldosterone, a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium balance. ACE, a key component of the RAS, converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. ACE2, on the other hand, counteracts the effects of ACE by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7), a vasodilator.

3. The system also includes various peptides and hormones, such as angiotensin II, EDN1 (endothelin-1), EDN2, and EDN3, which interact with their respective receptors to regulate vascular tone and blood pressure. AVPR1A and AVPR2, vasopressin receptors, play a role in regulating water and electrolyte balance.

4. Other proteins in the system, such as REN (renin), CTSZ (cathepsin Z), and NOX1 (NADPH oxidase 1), contribute to the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance through their interactions with other components of the RAS.

5. The system's architecture ensures a delicate balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation, with various components interacting in a synergistic or antagonistic manner to regulate blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The proportion of genes in the system involved in RAS regulation is high, indicating a strong association between this process and the system's functions.

While the system appears to be primarily involved in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system, some proteins (e.g., RASL10B, SERPINF2, F2RL1, NDST2, TACR1) do not have a clear functional connection to this process. However, their involvement in the system suggests a potential role in modulating RAS activity or interacting with other signaling pathways."	0.92
